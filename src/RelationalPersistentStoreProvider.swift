     Executes the given SQL data retrieval query (like, but not limited to SELECT) & returns the status of the operation YES/NO
     i.e. whether the query execution was successful or not.
     Remember the return value doesn't validate the logic of your query or it's validity to obtain the desired result at the logical/semantic
     level in any way. If the method returns NO, it could be due to one more of the following reasons:
     - there was error(s) in the query syntax
     - binded paramaters (number of parameters passed doesn't match with the ones supposed to be bind to the query)
     - runtime error like - integrity constraints were violated
     - or some internal error like the database was found to be locked (probably, owing to unbalanced call to open/close).
     
     Iterating over the result set & retrieving a row:
     -------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: This method in itself doesn't return the result set or cursor to the rows retrieved by executing the submitted query.
     This method just indicates if the query execution was successful or not. If this method returns YES, then one can iterate over the result
     set & retrieve the rows one by one using either of the methods below till they return NIL:
     func getNextRowAsArray() -> Array<Any>
     func getNextRowAsDictionary() -> NSDictionary

     Executing the query & retrieving the entire result set at once:
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     If one wants to execute the query & obtain the entire result set, then use this method:
     func getResultSetForQuery(_ query: String, withParams params: Array<Any>) -> Array<Any>

     @param query - SQL data retrieval query to execute
     @param params - an array of paramaters to be bound to the query; the parameters are bound based on their position in the query
     i.e. the paramater value for the 1st placeholder appears at 0th index in params array, 2nd at 1st index & so on.
     If the query doesn't have any placeholders & so, doesn't need to bind params, then pass NIL.

     Executes the given set of SQL statements as a transaction. The multiple SQL statements/queries shall be separated by new line i.e.
     each query appears on the new row.
     
     Handling the error/failure:
     ---------------------------
     In case there's problem completing the transaction, implementation of this method shall make sure that the transaction is rolled back
     & DB is restored to the previous known state. At no time, shall the DB be left in inconsistent state.
     The exact behaviour of 'Commit' & 'Rollback' depends upon the particular DB. For example, SQLite generally has it's auto-commit
     mode ON & so the rollback is taken care by the SQLite itself. For other's, this might need to be done explicitly.
     
     @param query - one or more SQL queries separated by new line
     @param paramSets - an array of paramaters array to be bound to each query (details as mentioned in executeQuery/executeUpdate methods).
     If the individual query doesn't have any parameters to bound, pass NSNULL; if all the queries are sans any paramater, then pass NIL.
     @param aTarget - reference/pointer to an object whose's selector shall be invoked as a callback to pass the result set of executing the
     queries in the transaction (if the query is selection/retrieval query indeed)
     @param aSelector - the selector to be called on execution of the queries to pass the corresponding result set.
     The supplied selector is invoked for each row in the result set;the selector must have the following signature:
     - 1st parameter contains the index of SQL statement in the transaction
     - 2nd parameter contains the row retrieved from the result set after executing the selection/retrieval statement at corresponding index.
     So, if there are 4 statements on the transaction & the 3rd is selection statement then selector will be invokded with following values:
     1st argument: 2 (as SQL statmenets in the transaction are counted starting from 0,the index of 3rd statement would be 2)
     2nd argument: row which is returned as NSDictionary so the user can look up the column names & retrieve the corresponding values.
     For e.g. the selector might look like
     - (void) handleResultRow:(NSDictionary *) row forQueryInTransactionAtIndex:(NSUInterger) queryIndexInTransaction;
