/**
 Lays down the contract for the classes that want to plug in themselves in the Client frameowrk by providing the
 following capabilities:
 - Data persistence
 - Retrieving and/or querying persisted data
 - Adding/Removing/Modifying the data
 
 The internal implementation or the exact technology to be used is specific to the class implementing this protocol.
 One class may opt to conform to this protocol by using relational DB like SQLite and implementation of protocol methods will
 then use SQLite specific semantics/APIs internally.
 Other class may use framework like Core Data internally, still other can choose to have a key-value based storage for implementing
 data persistence & related capabilities. Some classes can even employ proprietary mechanism for persisting/querying/maintaining
 the data.
 As long as the provider class conforms to this protocol, it can be used within the framework; internal implementation is
 prerogative of the provider.
 
 Client framwork provides the concrete implementation for the RDBMS based persistent data provider using SQLite.

     1. Open the store
     2. Perform one or more operations like add/update/get/remove
     3. Close the store
